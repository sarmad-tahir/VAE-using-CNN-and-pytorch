# VAE-using-CNN-and-pytorch


Used MNIST dataset and implemented the following steps:


1 - The VAE Model
2 - Kaiming Initialization also known as He Initialization (https://paperswithcode.com/method/he-initialization)
3 - The VAE loss function
4 - The forward pass
5 - The training loop
6 - The evaluation loop
7 - The sampling loop
8 - Visualize the latent space
